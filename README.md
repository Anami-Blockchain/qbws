qbws
=========

Goal: A Node.js based web service for integrating with Quickbooks Web Connector

## Status ##

This project replicates the functionality of the C# web service found in the QBSDK. Unfortunately that means some things are hard coded that should not be, and other things are left unimplemented. Eventually, qbws will diverge from that C# example to serve less of an SDK example and more as a reliable utility.

## Next Milestones ##
 - v0.2.0: loose port of [Intuit's WCWebService][1] provided in the QBSDK samples. (mostly complete; pending code review)
 - v0.2.1: include documentation for all functions (likely using JSDoc)
